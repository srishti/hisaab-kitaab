# Hisaab Kitaab

## Overview

**Hisaab Kitaab** is a bookkeeping application. It can manage expenses belonging to an individual user for personal uses. It can also manage expenses & income related to a business entity.

Traditionally, the businesses used 'bahi khaata' or ledgers to record their day-to-day transactions. **Hisaab Kitaab** makes it easy to maintain everything at a single place as a finance repository. One can now also view detailed reports time-to-time to get a deeper understanding of their business.

A major problem that we are trying to solve is to make the application easy-to-use for even those people who do not understand the financial terminologies. This will help such people to be able to manage their personal/business-related transactions. Therefore, the application ensures that there isn't a learning curve for Finance as a subject.

Currently, we have support for adding different types of accounts. Using these accounts, the user can record a transaction like the way it's typically done in a ledger. We provide a seemless and rich user experience.

## Future Scope

1. Integration with Fusion SDK can be done for a hassle-free process of opening a bank account of a user within the application.
2. The transactions from the integrated bank account can be downloaded and tagged to different accounts so that the application reflects a true picture of all transactions including those which take place offline outside the application.
3. The different modes can help non-finance-savvy people to manage their finances as well as people with sound financial knowledge to use the application for book-keeping.
4. The payments to different accounts can be settled via the application.
5. Rich filters can help users to find exactly what they need.
6. Multi-lingual support can help users use the application in their first language.
